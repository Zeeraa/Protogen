# Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project! Please ensure you follow these guidelines when contributing.

## Bug Reports

When reporting a bug, provide as much information as possible so we can reproduce the issue on our end. If possible, record the issue and include a link to the video in your bug report.

## Feature Requests

We are open to feature requests, but we will only accept those that are beneficial to multiple users and do not break existing installations.

## Code Style

Please adhere to the project's code style.

We use `.editorconfig` and `eslint` to maintain a consistent and safe code style. Ensure you have the necessary extensions installed in your editor. Before submitting a pull request, verify that your changes pass linting.

## Contributing Artwork

This project allows users to select from predefined textures for LED screens.

If you want to contribute artwork, place the files in `backend/assets/builtin` and update `AssetManifest.json` to include them. If contributing multiple related textures, you can organize them into subfolders within the built-in directory.

By submitting artwork, you agree that:
- It will be distributed under the same license as this repository.
- You either created it yourself or have explicit permission from the artist to contribute it.

You may add credits for artwork in `AssetManifest.json`, including links to social or personal websites, as long as they do not contain NSFW or illegal content.

The maintainers reserve the right to remove or deny any contributed artwork or links if deemed inappropriate.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same terms as this repository.

## Usage of AI-Generated Code

AI-generated code is allowed, but if you contribute AI-generated code, please ensure that:
- It follows our code style.
- You fully understand what the code does.

AI tools like Copilot and ChatGPT can be valuable for speeding up development, but relying on them entirely may result in inefficient, unsafe, or unmaintainable code.
