# Power supply
The hardware requires a higher amperage than a normal usb powerbank can deliver over 5 volts so you are going to need a beefy power source.

### Parts list
The included 3D print file is made for use with the following parts

* `Noctua NF-A4x10 5V` (Cooling)
* `Adafruit HUSB238` (USB PD)
* `AZDelivery XL4016E1 DC-DC Step Down Buck Converter` (Buck converter)
* `XT60 Connectors Pair` (Connector, any other connector should also work)
* `LED of your choise` A LED that indicates that the psu is on
* `220 ohm resistor` Resistor needed to power the led from the 5 volt line

For a portable power source that lasts several hours i would recommend the following:
* `Anker Prime 27650mAh Power Bank 250W`
